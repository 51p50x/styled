# Styled

Mini project using styled-components

# notes

- We shouldn't creat a styled component inside of a functional component (like the one that you export default), that could lead to a perfomance issue

- We should be careful when we send data through our style components or our functional components, things like external files, user inputs, database values. This could cause cross scripting issues
